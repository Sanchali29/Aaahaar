"Aahaar" is a web application designed to bridge the gap between surplus food providers, such as banquet halls and caterers, and individuals in need, facilitated through NGOs, orphanages, and elderly care facilities. With a dual purpose, it aims to minimize food wastage while also offering nourishing meals to those seeking support.
